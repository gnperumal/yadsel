**This is the definetely new name of old dbmigrations project - renamed because already exists a project with that name.**

## NOW WITH DJANGO SUPPORT ##

Django support includes a new driver, a command-line option for manage.py, a pluggable application and its history and log in the Admin.

## Details about Yadsel ##

The goal of this project is provide a library (and a tool) under the **LGPL**, writen with **Python** language for an object oriented and version based evolution of databases schema, independent of ORMs, operating systems or DBMS's.

This library must be adaptable to other languages, and only the versions scripts must be writen with Python, under the class system defined by library.

For now, we are working with MySQL driver, and the next will be (not necessarely in that order):
  * SQLite
  * Firebird
  * Django
  * SQLObject
  * Postgres
  * SQLServer
  * Oracle
  * SQLAlchemy

**You can help us** writing some of those drivers, or making good changes :)
